How to install Check_and_Clean utility files:

This utility checks for missing data by counting the number of fits files in the capture directory and checking that total against the number expected from the capture duration for that night. This indirectly checks for dropped frames, because dropped frames delay the start of the next fits file, which reduces the remaining time available to capture new fits files.

In the instructions below, the ~ symbol is a shorthand for the directory path down to the directory following the symbol. In most cases ~ means /home/pi.

Start a terminal session. Usually this puts you in ~/source/RMS, and if so, you need to cd .. to the ~/source directory. At this point your terminal session should be in ~/source.

Enter this command to clone the Check_and_Clean files to your station:

Next, make sure that the Check_and_Clean.sh is executable:
chmod +x *.sh

Next, follow the steps in README.md to enable Check_and_Clean as your external script, or add it to your existing external script.
